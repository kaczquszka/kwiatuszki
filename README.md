# Personality to Plant Classification - main idea

This project is an NLP-based personality classification application that maps user responses from a quiz to a symbolic “inner plant” archetype. The system analyzes free-text answers using sentiment analysis powered by a fine-tuned DistilBERT model and a k-nearest neighbors classifier.

The application is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web app and can be accessed via link: https://what-is-your-inner-plant.streamlit.app/


# What is the logic behind the classificatiton?
The questions you answered were mapped to specific traits of plants.
