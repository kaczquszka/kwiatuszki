# Personality-to-Plant Classification

This project is an NLP-based personality classification application that maps user responses from a quiz to a symbolic “inner plant” archetype. The system analyzes free-text answers using sentiment analysis powered by a fine-tuned DistilBERT model and a k-nearest neighbors classifier.

The application is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web app and can be accessed via link: https://what-is-your-inner-plant.streamlit.app/


# The main idea behined the project
What is your inner plant?
Have you ever wondered what plant best matches your character and personality?
You probably did not, but becouse of my app you can get to know that :)
